The previous example of launching rocket project was executed using similar commands,

Hence the shell scripts helps to group these common commands together into an executable file
with an extension of { .sh }. 


- This helps in automating the execution of manual tasks.

- The .sh file runs each command mentioned in the executable file sequentially.

- Even if any command is taking longer time for execution it'll first complete the execution 
  before moving ahead.

- To list the location of the script : which rocket-launch




# { Commands to make a script file with commands in it } #

- touch create-and-launch-rocket.sh : This creates the .sh file.

- use vi editor to insert commands in the file.

- chmod +x create-and-launch-rocket : this assigns the execute permission for the .sh file mentioned.

- bash create-and-launch-rocket : used to run the script command







Manual approach : {Lab}


mkdir /home/bob/countries
cd countries

mkdir USA
touch capital.txt
echo "Washington, D.C" >> capital.txt

cd ..
mkdir UK
touch capital.txt
echo "London" >> capital.txt

cd ..
mkdir India
touch capital.txt
echo "New Delhi" >> capital.txt

uptime



Optimised Approach :


vi create-directory-structure-v2.sh

mkdir countries

mkdir -p countries/USA countries/India countries/UK

echo "Washington, D.C" > countries/USA/capital.txt
echo "London" > countries/UK/capital.txt
echo "New Delhi" > countries/India/capital.txt

uptime
