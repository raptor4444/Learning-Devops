- using command create-and-launch-rocket :

	- we want the user to type the mission name.


- This is done by specifying the read command in script file :

	- The command is :

		read -p "Enter Mission name: " mission_name


- This above command reads the input given by user and assigns the value to mission_name (variable).

- This variable is further used in rest of scripts.

- This process requires manual intervention by the user for the script to be executed and hence should be used accordingly.

- The scripts should be developed such that it does not require any manual intervention unless absolutely necessary.
