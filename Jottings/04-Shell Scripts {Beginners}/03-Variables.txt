#- VARIABLES -#


	- Variables are in general used for preventing the repetetion of a constant value.

	- It helps in the easy manipulation of data, which further gives the flexiblity in scaling the product that is being made.
	
	- In Scripting we use variables for the same purpose for not repeating the code.

	- In this the variable name should contain only alphanumeric and underscores.
		 "mission_name {acceptable}" while "mission-name {is not}"

	- Here the name is also case sensitive, ie,
		MISSION_NAME != mission_name

	- Best Practice for naming variables :
		- use lower case only.
		- underscore to seperate words.



# {EXAMPLE:}



mission_name = mars-mission		{Here we are creating a variable for the mission}

mkdir $mission_name

rocket add $mission_name

rocket-start-power $mission_name

rocket-start-engine $mission-name

roccket-lift-off $mission-name

rocket-status $mission-name
