#- Netwroking basics: { Switching & Routing }



Q) What is route?

	-- command used to display the kernel ip routing table.

	-- We can assign multiple IP to a system
							
	-- Router is a preferred device to connect two system which are on different networks?
					
	-- Gateway connect a system to the internet.



# Adding IP address at different app(applications) using jumphost:


	- For lab: when we switch to app01 in KodeKloud Lab:

		sudo ip addr add 172.16.238.15/24 dev eth0		-- used to assign ip address {here assigned to app02}


	- For lab: when we switch to app02 in KodeKloud Lab:
		
		sudo ip addr add 172.16.238.16/24 dev eth0		-- used to assign ip address {here assigned to app02}	
	

	- To exit app use "exit" or "login".


	- NOTE : Jumphost can be only be used for the devices that are currently on the same network.
