# Python :

- It is a free open source cross platform comaptible programming language.
- Has soo many features that helped to support modern tech such as machine learning, data science, and AI.

# Versions :

- Python 2 (2000-2010)
	
	- Released in 2000.
	- Development ended in 2010.

- Python 3 (2008-present)

	- Initially released in 2008 and is continued to be developed today.
	- Also Python 3 does not gurantee the backward compatibility with python 2 applicatons.

- Note: Applications made on Python 2 should be run on Python 2 Interpreter and same for python 3.

- To install python3.6 - use < sudo yum install python36 > (dont use decimal for python version).

- We can install both versions of python on the same host.



# Running python files:

- use version with the file name:

	- <python2 filename>
	- <python3 filename>




# Python Pakage Manager {PIP} :


- When we install python we it also installs PIP automatically.

- use <pip1 -v> and <pip2 -v> to see PIP pointing to which version of python.

- To install a pakage using pip : <pip install package>

- Seperate packages are installed in sperate folders for different versions.

- Packages are 32 bit and 64 bit. Ex: if 64 bit then it has sepeate path for 64 bit packages.

- To know where the package is installed or any other info, use : <pip show pakage>

- For installing multiple pakage file :
	
	- To install multiple packages we can use : <pip install package1 package2 package3>
	
	- Or we can we a efficient method :

		- Create a package.txt using file write required packages name.

			{ package1==version
			  package2==version
			  package3==version		
			}

		- Note: The brackets above are just for the mentions, need not to be included.
	
		- Now to install the packages, use : <pip install -r package.txt>
	
		- If the version is not mentioned above this will allow python to install the latest stable version of package
		  and it might not be compatible with the version on which the python application was built. Hence, may break.
	
	- To uninstall the package, use : < pip uninstall package >
	
	- To know which pakages are not installed in following : <pip show package1 package2 package3 package4>

	- To install the upgraded version of already installed package: <pip install package --upgrade>


# Other Package Managers:


1) easy_install :

	- This was the original way of installing of python packages.
	- Here a set of tools are used to package Python code into zipped format called eggs (Ex - app.egg).
	- Egg file is similar to jars in java to package it into a single file.
	- this .egg file can be installed using : (easy_install install app).
	- The .egg file doesn't require to be unpackaged. It can be directly be used.

2) wheels :

	- have an extension : file.whl
	- similar to .egg files which are also zip files. 
	- But the difference is that it need to be unpacked before installing.
