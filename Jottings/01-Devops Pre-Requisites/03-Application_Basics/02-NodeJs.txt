# NodeJS

- Nodejs supports large number of pakage/libraries that are developed by either the core team or contributed by community.


# NPM (Node Pakage Manager):

- These could be the pakages for working with files, web servers, databases, security, and many more.

- And all of it are available on public repository at npmjs.com.

- When nodejs is installed then a command line utility is also installed ie., (npm).

- npm helps to interact with npm respository.

- use ( npm -v ) to print the version of nodejs intalled.

- ( npm search file ) to search a pakage in repository. It consists of name, author, version, description.

- Once the pakage is to be installed then install it using <npm install filename>.

- The installed pakages are stored in the library (lib) folder under node_modules folder.

- The node_module folder also consist of a folder named "file" which further consist of pakage.json file.

- The pakage.jason file consists of the metadata of the pakagae. MetaData consist of name, author, version , git repo, etc..

- All the above commands were used to install pakages to a directory we need the pakage be working on. 

- If we want to install the nodejs pakage globally we use "-g" : example -> ( npm install file -g )

- To clone node applications from github use ( git clone "githublink" ).


# Modules :

- Are of two types:
	
	- Internal Module : Here the modules are installed automatically when the nodejs in installed for the first time.
				Ex -> fs (handle file system), HTTP (host an http server), OS (work with operating system)
	
	- External Module : The modules are manually installed as per need.
				Ex -> Express (develop web applications), react (Front-end interface), Debug (debug applications)
